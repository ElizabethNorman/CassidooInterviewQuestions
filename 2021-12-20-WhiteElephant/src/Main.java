 *
 * Design a data structure and functions for a white elephant game. Youâ€™ll want to have a set of players and gifts they
 * bring, and the gifts they end up with in the end!
 * Rules are from : https://www.whiteelephantrules.com/
 *
 * This was so much fun to code! I loved it. I could definitely add more and make the process more automated by I've
 * already spent enough time on this, I think I have reached a satisfactory end :)
